** Why the Nubank started to use flutter? 
   The flutter started to be used on Nubank to give us a fast way to developer feature to both plataforms using the same codebase.
   The key beneficities of this approuch is:
   - The app comes to be more consistent between plataforms.
   - We can use the same languages and common features
   - the learning curve is more smooth
   
** The tools used to create apps with flutter
   - Nuds: The nuds is a package created by the nubanks with a lot of components that follow the System Design from nubank
     Today we hava a app in the play store for test and try theses components.

   - Monocli: Monocli is a tool similar to nucli but focused only on mobile the idea is to have some commands to help the engineers in your day to day.

   - Bors: is a CI tool, basicaly today we a have mono repository for mobile with all plataforms inside, and we receive a lot of PRs per day, the bors
     do the management from this PRs. For example the bors there is the capacity to merge more that one PR per time.

** The Architeture
   
   - Navigation == Routes
     This layer is reposible to know how each screen will be appresented, what trasition animation will be used 
     and which screen will be presensented and when.

   - domain == logic
     The domain layers is reposible for business logic, we made the use of use cases pattern to apply this logics following the clean architeture. 

   - data == models/schemata/diplomata
     the is the layers where we can access remote data sources or local data sources

   - presentation
     Widgets and presentation logic

   - bloc (Bloc Logic Component)
     this component separete the presentation layer from the business logic
     the idea is that the block layers recevei events from the uses make business logic and return a new state for the screen
     this state basicaly represents how the screen will looks like.
